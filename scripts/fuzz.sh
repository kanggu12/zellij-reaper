# Go's fuzzing engine now and then ends a run at its time limit with "context
# deadline exceeded" although it found nothing: no failing input is written,
# and the same run passes when tried again (about once in two dozen runs here,
# once in the release work). Such a run is tried once more. Any other failure,
# or the same one twice, stops.
